# Master script to benchmark VigNAT-related programs.
# Can benchmark different implementations, including non-NATs,
# using different scenarios.

# Parameters:
# $1: The app, either a known name or a DPDK NAT-like app.
#     Known names: "netfilter".
#     Otherwise, a folder name containing a DPDK NAT-like app, e.g. "~/vnds/nat"
# $2: The scenario, one of the following:
#     "mg-1p": Measure throughput: find the rate at which the middlebox
#              starts losing 1% of packets.
#     "mg-existing-flows-latency": Measure the forwarding latency for existing
#                                  flows.
#     "mg-new-flows-latency": Measure the forwarding latency for new flows.
#     "loopback": Measure throughput.
#                 Tester and middlebox are connected together in a loop,
#                 using 2 interfaces on each, in different subnets; server is ignored.
#     "1p": Measure throughput.
#           Find the point at which the middlebox starts dropping 1% of packets.
#     "passthrough": Measure latency.
#                    Tester sends packets to server, which pass through the middlebox;
#                    all machines are in the same subnet.
#     "rr": Measure latency.
#           Tester sends packets to server, which are modified by the middlebox;
#           there are two subnets, tester-middlebox and middlebox-server.
#           a.k.a. request/response
# $3: The type of NF, either NAT/Br/LB/Pol/FW/NOP
#     For running programs such as netfilter please provide the NF it is being used as a baseline for:.
