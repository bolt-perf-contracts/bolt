Last decade is marked by a second coming of virtualization. The birth of cloud
put a great demand on systems to be portable and replaceable. Now entire
networks follow computing nodes and become virtualizable. That is how the SDN
was born. As it advances more and more originally hardware functions move to the
portable and flexible software domain.

However, the software development methods do not keep up with the raising
responsibility. It is traditionally difficult to develop a reliable software
implementation of an originally hardware component.

On the other side, formal verification techniques have grown strong enough to
certify complete and practical systems. Such systems as a compiler, an operating
system kernel, a distributed key value store or a file system.

We take advantage of network domain-specific features and formal methods
achievements to guarantee the reliability of each component.
